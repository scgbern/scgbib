# Linkchecker

[genLinkcheckHTML.py](genLinkcheckHTML.py) is a Python script that reads the `scgbib.json` file and generates an HTML file containing all the links found in the bibliographic entries.
The generated HTML is then checked by [linkchecker.command](linkchecker.command) using [Linkchecker](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/).
