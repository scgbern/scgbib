# Scripts

These scripts are used by the `make` rules in the [Makefile](../Makefile):

- [bibsort](bibsort) : Perl script to sort the scg.bib by key
- [SYNC-scgbib2Yogi.command](SYNC-scgbib2Yogi.command) : shell script to rsync the entire repo to the (old) server
- [testbib.rb](testbib.rb) : Ruby script to test the consistency of the scg.bib file

To do: move the tests and server update to github actions.
