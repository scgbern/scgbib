# SCG Bibliography

The `scg.bib` file is a [bibtex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file containing bibliographic entries used for most of the [publications of the Software Composition Group](http://scg.unibe.ch/publications).
It is also used as input for the online [SCG bibliography search engine](http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib).

This repo is a migration of the old scgbib repo formerly hosted on the SCG git repo.

The search engine is based on a [prototype](https://github.com/AlexandruFilipescu/Citation-Search-Engine) written by
[Alexandru Filipescu](https://github.com/AlexandruFilipescu) as part of a [seminar project](http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/projects/mastersbachelorsprojects/Implementing-a-citation-search-engine-in-JavaScript).
